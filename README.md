Kessler Syndrome Board Game Reference Generator

This program was built to rapidly build reference materials for the development of the 
Kessler Syndrome board game. With frequent changes to rules and balance, this program can 
reduce the cost of updating reference sheets and materials from hours of tedious labour 
between test sessions to a few seconds, allowing for rapid iteration. 


The board game is still actively in production and all things are still prone to change.

An example of the result of generating a cost reference sheet can be found in example.csv
which can be imported into a spreadsheet for easy viewing.
